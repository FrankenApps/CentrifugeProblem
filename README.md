# Centrifuge Problem
Inspired by a _numberphile_ video I created this tiny web app, in order to determine if the Centrifuge Problem has a solution, for a given number

## How it works
Simply enter the number of equally spaced holes on the circle into the input field an click calculate. Internally I am using complex numbers. At first equally spaced points on a unit circle in the complex plane are created. If the sum of these complex numbers adds up to zero, this basically means, that the centroid is at the origin, so that all moments of deviation disappear.
